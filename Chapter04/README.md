# Classification

**Classification**, a typical type of supervised learning, is to learn the features and label values of data given as learning data through machine learning algorithms to generate models and predict unknown label values when new data values are given.

### 1. Naive Bayes
- A kind of classifier which uses the Bayes Theorem

### 2. Logistic Regression
- Based on the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables

### 3. Decision Tree
- Rule-based on data uniformity

### 4. Support Vector Machine
- Effectively finds the best classification margin between individual classes

### 5. Nearest Neighbor
- Based on the proximity distance

### 6. Neural Network
- Based on deep connectivity

### 7. Ensemble
- Combining different (or same) machine learning algorithms
